### System introductions
To build a car rental system based on the SSM framework, the car rental system is divided into two large modules, namely the system module and the business module. Among them, there are sub-modules under the system module and business module. The system module realizes functions such as user login and menu management, and the business module realizes functions such as customer management, rental and return, and statistical analysis. The system has powerful functions and complex business logic. If it is implemented manually, it will lead to inefficient and error-prone problems. But whether it is an administrator or an enterprise, it will be much more convenient and efficient to manage the rental information through the Internet system. First of all, the administrator can directly view the user's order online, manage the return of the vehicle, and manage the rental car order in real time, thus avoiding useless and inefficient manpower management methods and ensuring the accuracy and efficiency of system management.
